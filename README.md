# Sandhyakala
Sandhyakala is an object-oriented programming project for an online shop application that specializes in selling batik products from Pekalongan, Indonesia. However, local batik products in Pekalongan suffer from a lack of promotion and marketing, leading to lower prices when sold. Sandhyakala aims to provide a platform for these batik products to be sold at a fair price while also helping batik SMEs in Indonesia.
